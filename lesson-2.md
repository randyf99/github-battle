#React Components
- Components are the building blocks of React. 
- Similar to Directives in Angular
- Widgets or modules in other libraries, frameworks or languages.
- You can think of a component as a collection of HTML, CSS, JS, and some internal data specific to that component.
- What makes React so convenient for building user interfaces is that data is either received from a component’s parent component, or it’s contained in the component itself.

#NPM Install
- npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react css-loader style-loader html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-dev-server
